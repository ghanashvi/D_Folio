# MY project aims to create a decentralized file storage and sharing platform that leverages the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storing images 
# blockchain technology used for for access control and immutability. 
# The platform allows users to upload images, securely store them on IPFS via Pinata, and manage access permissions. 
# By combining the strengths of IPFS, blockchain, and a user-friendly frontend built with React, I provide a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for image storage and sharing.
